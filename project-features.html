                    <p>Snap is a mobile application that tries to improve the short comings of the existing and
                        previously used scheduling systems.

                    <p>Traditionally, people used different methods to schedule and manage their time and tasks. This
                        includes memorizing of tasks in their mind (which is still done by a significant number of people),
                        while others use paper to write down their schedules.

                <div class="grid-cell cell-2">
                    <p>The proposed system is an attempt to provide a solution for most of the shortcomings of the existing systems mentioned in the previous sections. The main innovation of this project is the importance it places on the dynamic nature of students’ lives.

                        and programming paradigms must be used.
